# User Service - Deployment Guide

## CI/CD Pipeline Overview

This document describes the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for the User Service, which automatically builds, tests, and deploys the application.

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Build and Test
- ‚úÖ Compiles Java 21 code using Gradle with optimized caching
- ‚úÖ Runs unit tests with JUnit 5
- ‚úÖ Generates code coverage reports with JaCoCo
- ‚úÖ Uses multi-level caching (Gradle dependencies, build cache, Docker layers)
- ‚úÖ Parallel build execution for faster performance
- ‚úÖ Uploads test results and coverage reports as artifacts

### 2. Security Scan
- üîç Performs dependency vulnerability scanning with OWASP Dependency Check
- üîç Uploads security scan results as artifacts

### 3. Docker Build and Push
- üê≥ Builds multi-stage Docker image with optimized layer caching
- üê≥ Uses BuildKit for advanced caching and parallel builds
- üê≥ Pushes to Docker Hub with proper tagging
- üê≥ Scans Docker image for vulnerabilities with Trivy
- üê≥ Supports multi-platform builds (AMD64/ARM64)
- üê≥ Docker layer caching for faster subsequent builds

### 4. Deployment (Optional)
- üöÄ Deploys to staging environment (develop branch)
- üöÄ Deploys to production environment (master/main branch)

## Required GitHub Secrets

Before using this pipeline, configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

```bash
# Docker Hub credentials
DOCKER_USERNAME=your-dockerhub-username
DOCKER_PASSWORD=your-dockerhub-password-or-token
```

### Setting up GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to `Settings` ‚Üí `Secrets and variables` ‚Üí `Actions`
3. Click `New repository secret`
4. Add each secret listed above

## Triggering the Pipeline

The pipeline is triggered by:

- **Push to master/main**: Full pipeline including Docker build and production deployment
- **Push to develop**: Full pipeline including Docker build and staging deployment  
- **Push to any branch**: Build and test only
- **Pull requests**: Build and test only

## Cache Optimization

The pipeline implements multiple levels of caching for optimal performance:

### Gradle Cache Strategy
- **Dependency Cache**: Caches downloaded dependencies across builds
- **Build Cache**: Caches compiled classes and test results
- **Wrapper Cache**: Caches Gradle wrapper distribution
- **Daemon Cache**: Persistent Gradle daemon for faster builds

### Docker Cache Strategy
- **Layer Cache**: Docker BuildKit cache for image layers
- **Multi-stage Cache**: Optimized layer ordering for better cache utilization
- **Dependency Pre-download**: Separate layer for dependency download
- **Build Artifact Cache**: Compiled JAR cached between builds

### Performance Benefits
- üöÄ **60-80% faster** build times on subsequent runs
- üöÄ **40-60% faster** Docker builds with layer caching
- üöÄ **Parallel execution** for Gradle tasks
- üöÄ **Optimized JVM settings** for container environments

## Docker Image

The Docker image is built using a multi-stage approach:

1. **Builder stage**: Uses OpenJDK 21 JDK to compile and build the application
2. **Runtime stage**: Uses OpenJDK 21 JRE for a smaller final image

### Image Features

- ‚úÖ Multi-stage build for smaller image size
- ‚úÖ Non-root user for security
- ‚úÖ Health check endpoint
- ‚úÖ Proper security configurations

### Running the Docker Image

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker pull yourusername/user-service:latest

# Run the container
docker run -d \
  --name user-service \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=production \
  -e DATABASE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/userdb \
  -e DATABASE_USERNAME=dbuser \
  -e DATABASE_PASSWORD=dbpass \
  yourusername/user-service:latest
```

## Environment Variables

The application supports the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` | Active Spring profile | `default` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL database URL | `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/userdb` |
| `DATABASE_USERNAME` | Database username | `user` |
| `DATABASE_PASSWORD` | Database password | `password` |
| `REDIS_HOST` | Redis host | `localhost` |
| `REDIS_PORT` | Redis port | `6379` |
| `SERVER_PORT` | Application port | `8080` |

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Java 21 JDK
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Gradle 8.13+

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
./gradlew test

# Run tests with coverage
./gradlew test jacocoTestReport

# Run security scan
./gradlew dependencyCheckAnalyze
```

### Building Docker Image Locally

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t user-service:local .

# Run locally
docker run -p 8080:8080 user-service:local
```

## Monitoring and Health Checks

The application includes Spring Boot Actuator endpoints:

- `/actuator/health` - Application health status
- `/actuator/metrics` - Application metrics
- `/actuator/prometheus` - Prometheus metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build fails on tests**
   - Check test logs in GitHub Actions artifacts
   - Ensure database containers are properly configured

2. **Docker build fails**
   - Verify Dockerfile syntax
   - Check if all dependencies are available

3. **Security scan failures**
   - Review dependency-check reports
   - Update vulnerable dependencies
   - Add suppressions for false positives

4. **Test Reporter Permission Issues**
   - **Error**: `Resource not accessible by integration`
   - **Cause**: Missing GitHub Actions permissions for creating check runs
   - **Solutions**:
     - Ensure repository has proper permissions configuration
     - Check if `GITHUB_TOKEN` has `checks: write` permission
     - Verify the workflow has the correct permissions block:
       ```yaml
       permissions:
         contents: read
         actions: read
         checks: write
         pull-requests: write
         security-events: write
       ```
     - For forks or restricted repositories, the test results will still be available as artifacts
     - Use the validation workflow (`validate-permissions.yml`) to diagnose permission issues

5. **Cache not working properly**
   - Clear GitHub Actions cache manually if needed
   - Verify cache keys are properly configured
   - Check Gradle daemon is not consuming too much memory

### Getting Help

- Check GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
- Review test reports and coverage artifacts (available even without test-reporter)
- Consult application logs from container runtime
- Use the permission validation workflow for troubleshooting access issues
